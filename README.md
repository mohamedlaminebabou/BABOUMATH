# MatrixBabou
  
This library is for matrix analysis and data mining. Its created to facilitate some of notable tools in linear algebra like the matrix decompositions and the classical products (Kronecker, Khatri-Rao, Hadamard..) , and all this functions are accelerated via the parallel computing methods.

## Installation
``` python3 -m pip install --user  MatrixBabou```



## How to use it?
It's used for Linear Algebra , matrix decompsition : NMF Decompsition $\mathbf{M\approx UV}$ ,
 and also for solving  matrix least square problem  : $\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}\min_{X\in \mathbb {R}{n\times m}}\|AX-B\|^2_{F}}$
.
